This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Fetch the data from here https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/postsLinks to an external site and create a very basic list of blog posts.

Just show the titles, and just show the first 5 blog posts.

Underneath the first 5 blog posts a button is added so when we click that button, it will add the next 5 posts. When we click it again, it will add another 5 posts and so on.
